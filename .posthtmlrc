Three days before Columbia football’s 2019 home opener, the athletic department stripped the band of the remainder of its University funding.

After this, the athletic department informed Vivian Klotz, BC ’20, who was the head manager at the time, and then-drum major Cameron Danesh, SEAS ’20, that in order to maintain the band’s funding from the department it must become a recognized group. Previously the CUMB was a part of a special subsection of student organizations that are not formally recognized by the Student Governing Board nor the Activities Board, but that still receive University funding. In the months following the notice from the athletic department, the marching band did not submit its paperwork for recognition and the department stayed true to its word."

When asked, marching band leadership did not disclose which status was decided upon. However, those at the meeting claimed that neither option received the ⅔ majority needed. If the band chose not to legally dissolve, it would not have to give up possession of all the funds it raised, but instead it will remain in an account until a new band arises."
